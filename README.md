## Description

üîç The motivation for this project was to update Google Books API search engine webpage with all the skills I acquired so far and change it to a MERN Stack build. The reason for this is because to be able to sell myself to potential employers is to show them see what I can actually do with my skills and what I can provide to them. For this project I learn that to better improve myself I need to continuously learn all the new tips and knowledge that I can  implement in every project that I can get my hands on. With my projects i like to give them a more personal touch depending on each project that i work on.
